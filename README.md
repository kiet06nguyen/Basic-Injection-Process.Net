## How to Run
Requirements:

`.NET Framework (Compatible version, e.g., .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later)`

`Visual Studio (Recommended for easier compilation and debugging)`

- You need to add 1 dll to the project's properties and change the build action of that dll to an embedded resource, and then replace the path with the same path you just added
